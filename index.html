    <h1>My name is Brendan</h1>
    <p>I am a student at Wake Tech in the Cloud Infrastructure pathway. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, going on hikes with my dog Cooper, and working on mechanical projects. This is my first time working with CSS and HTML files. I am looking forward to learning more as we get further through the semester.</p>
